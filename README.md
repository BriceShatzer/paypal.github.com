### About

Initial thoughts: We looked at using the github SDK, **but** since we have so many repos (eg: SDK's are not really relevant OSS projects)
this resulted in a very large list.

We settled on a curated list found in `projects.js`. The idea is to give the website maintainer a single point of editing,
without having to worry about html, etc.


### Project Pages

The `gh-pages` branch of a repo is used to generate [project pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages#project-pages). These static web pages are served under subpaths of the organization's domain --- e.g., `paypal.github.io/repo-name/`.

The following is a list of known PayPal repos with `gh-pages` branches:
